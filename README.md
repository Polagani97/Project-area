# SMART HOME

# 1. Introduction
# 1.1 Purpose

The smart house is a domestic extension of building automation that involves controlling and 
automating all of its embedded technologies. It refers to a home with appliances, lighting, 
heating, air conditioning, televisions, computers, entertainment systems, large home 
appliances such as washers/dryers and refrigerators/freezers, security and camera systems that 
can communicate with one another and be controlled remotely via a time schedule, phone, 
mobile, or the internet. These systems are made up of switches and sensors that are connected 
to a central hub and may be operated by a house resident using a wall-mounted terminal or a 
mobile device that is connected to the internet via cloud services. Security, energy efficiency, 
minimal running costs, and convenience are all advantages of a smart home. Smart product 
installation provides convenience as well as time, money, and energy savings. Such systems 
are adaptable and changeable to satisfy the tenants' ever-changing demands. In most situations, 
its architecture is adaptable enough to work with a variety of devices from various 
manufacturers and standards. A typical smart home is outfitted with a number of sensors that 
monitor things like temperature, humidity, light, and proximity. Each sensor is solely 
responsible for capturing one or more measurements. One sensor may monitor temperature 
and humidity, while others compute the light ratio for a specific region and the distance from 
it to each object exposed to it. All sensors enable the user to save data and visualise it so that 
it may be seen anywhere and at any time.

# 1.2 Intended Audience:
By implementing the idea of smart home it would generate a sense of security in the people 
which would encourage them to implement it for convenience, for the ease of use, savings and 
to control. Most of the individuals who live in single-family homes are most likely to use the 
smart technology for having to save money and time.

# Smart Home: 
The electronics in a smart home are all networked and may be controlled 
from one central location—a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or gaming console. One home 
automation system can operate door locks, televisions, thermostats, home monitors, 
cameras, lights, and even appliances like the refrigerator. The system is installed on a 
mobile or other networked device, and the user may set up timers for changes to take 
effect. Self-learning capabilities are included into smart home appliances, allowing 
them to learn the homeowner's schedules and make modifications as needed. Lighting 
management in smart homes allows homeowners to save money on energy by reducing the amount of power they consume. When motion is detected in the home while the 
homeowner is away, some home automation systems send an alarm to the homeowner, 
while others can summon the authorities—police or the fire department—in the event 
of an emergency. Services like a smart doorbell, smart security system, and smart 
appliances become part of the internet of things (IoT) technology, which is a network 
of physical items that can gather and share electronic information, once linked.

# IoT:
 The Internet of Things refers to the billions of physical devices linked to the 
internet and collecting and sharing data throughout the world. It's now feasible to 
transform everything, from a pill to a jet, into a component of the Internet of Things, 
thanks to the advent of super-cheap computer chips and the widespread availability of 
wireless networks. Connecting all of these diverse products and attaching sensors to 
them gives machines that would otherwise be dumb a level of digital intelligence, 
allowing them to convey real-time data without engaging a person. The Internet of 
Things is bringing the digital and physical worlds together to make the world around 
us smarter and more responsive.

# MQTT:
 MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight open messaging protocol 
that allows network clients with limited resources to easily distribute telemetry data in 
low-bandwidth scenarios. The protocol is used in a variety of sectors, including 
automotive, energy, and telecommunications.

# Commands to run the project in a local machine

"npm run start" to initialise and set the port

"npm run start-dev" to run the application with the application accessible at localhost:8080

"npm run test" to run the test scripts to test the application.
